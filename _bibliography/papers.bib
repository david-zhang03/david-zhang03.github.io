  abstract={We introduce Cell2Sentence (C2S), a novel method to directly adapt large language models to a biological context, specifically single-cell transcriptomics. By transforming gene expression data into "cell sentences," C2S bridges the gap between natural language processing and biology. We demonstrate cell sentences enable the fine-tuning of language models for diverse tasks in biology, including cell generation, complex cell-type annotation, and direct data-driven text generation. Our experiments reveal that GPT-2, when fine-tuned with C2S, can generate biologically valid cells based on cell type inputs, and accurately predict cell types from cell sentences. This illustrates that language models, through C2S fine-tuning, can acquire a significant understanding of single-cell biology while maintaining robust text generation capabilities. C2S offers a flexible, accessible framework to integrate natural language processing with transcriptomics, utilizing existing models and libraries for a wide range of biological applications.}

      abstract={Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across many domains, relying on pretraining over vast amounts of data. Graph-structured data often lacks the same scale as unstructured data, making the development of graph foundation models challenging. In this work, we propose Foundation-Informed Message Passing (FIMP), a Graph Neural Network (GNN) message-passing framework that leverages pretrained non-textual foundation models in graph-based tasks. We show that the self-attention layers of foundation models can effectively be repurposed on graphs to perform cross-node attention-based message-passing. Our model is evaluated on a real-world image network dataset and two biological applications (single-cell RNA sequencing data and fMRI brain activity recordings) in both finetuned and zero-shot settings. FIMP outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that it can effectively leverage state-of-the-art foundation models in graph tasks.}

	abstract = {The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has quickly become a daunting challenge to global health. In the absence of targeted therapy and a reported 5.5% case fatality rate in the United States, treatments preventing rapid cardiopulmonary failure are urgently needed. Clinical features, pathology and homology to better understood pathogens suggest that uncontrolled inflammation and a cytokine storm likely drive COVID-19's unrelenting disease process. Interventions that are protective against acute lung injury and ARDS can play a critical role for patients and health systems during this pandemic. Nitric oxide is an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory molecule with key roles in pulmonary vascular function in the context of viral infections and other pulmonary disease states. This article reviews the rationale for exogenous nitric oxide use for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and highlights its potential for contributing to better clinical outcomes and alleviating the rapidly rising strain on healthcare capacity.},
