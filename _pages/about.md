Hi! I study Statistics, Chemistry, and Computer Science at Yale. I also do research with the [van Dijk lab](https://vandijklab.org/) focused on biological foundation models, language models, and flow matching. I have also enjoyed serving as an undergraduate learning assistant for machine learning and statistics courses.

I previously did research at [Calico Labs](https://www.calicolabs.com/) across the Discovery Data Science and Oncology teams. There, I developed metabolic models for target discovery in tumor indications.
I am also an open source contributor to [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/). 

My broad interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and the natural sciences (AI4Science), particularly in the applications of machine learning to biology and the drug discovery process. I am also casually interested in reinforcement learning, deep learning theory, mechanistic interpretability, and (biotech) startups.
