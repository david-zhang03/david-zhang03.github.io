This is a running list of blog ideas that I will probably never finish through.
Also first test to see if my blog page is actually working.

Blog list:
1. How much impact has / will machine learning had / have on biology and drug discovery?
2. The connections between human perception and machine learning (This seems connected to the idea below)
3. Understanding the history of deep learning
4. Protein language models and the challenges of structural prediction
5. A comprehensive guide to PyTorch operations and tricks (not sure how useful this is?)
6. How to balance between curiousity and impact when writing a blog (long-term)?

This is a place for random thoughts and ideas. Please feel free to suggest more ideas or comments
